<p>Holi is the Hindu "Festival of Colours," a vibrant, joyful celebration marking the arrival of spring and signifying the victory of good over evil.</p>
<p>Holi also celebrates the arrival of spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love. It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season. It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>Playing with Colours: The second day involves smearing coloured powders and throwing water, representing the blossoming of love and the arrival of spring. </p>
